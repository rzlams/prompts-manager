This project is a **Prompt Manager** designed to organize and manage LLM prompts and related development tasks using a file-based system. It heavily relies on Markdown files for defining prompts, tasks, and requirements.

# Folder Structure

-   **Root Directory**: Contains the main project folders and configuration files like `.gitignore`.
    -   `prompts/`: Stores various `.md` files that define specific prompts, roles, and guidelines for interacting with an LLM.
    -   `tasks/`: Contains project management documents in `.md` format.
