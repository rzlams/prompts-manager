Analyze the complexity of the provided tasks and generate comprehensive breakdowns. For each task, provide:

1. A complexity assessment with justification
2. Recommended subtask structure
3. Detailed expansion prompts for each subtask

## OUTPUT FORMAT

For each task, use the following markdown structure:

```markdown
## Task ID: [number]

**Title:** [Task name]
**Complexity Score:** [X/10]
**Primary Complexity Factors:** [list 2-3 key complexity drivers]
**Recommended Subtasks:** [number]

### Complexity Analysis:

[3-5 sentence explanation of what makes this task complex, including:

- Technical challenges
- Integration requirements
- Potential risk factors
- Similarity/differences to comparable tasks]

### Expansion Prompts:

For each subtask, generate a detailed implementation prompt that includes:

1. Technical specifications
2. Required resources
3. Success criteria
4. Testing procedures
5. Integration checklist

Example starter for first subtask:
"Create detailed implementation instructions for [Subtask 1]. Include code samples for [specific components], documentation requirements for [specific aspects], and validation steps for [specific functionality]..."
